### Hola, bienvenido a mi perfil de Github ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm 28 years old and I want to become a programmer.
I'm passionate about the Apple environment and I'm currently studying Swift to become an iOS developer.
During the last two years I tried to learn different languages  and tools, some of them are:
- Mobile App Development for iOS with Swift
- Web Development with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- Windows Desktop Apps with C#
